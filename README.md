# FacialFeaturesDetector-MIESTermProject
This is the project page for the "Emotion Recognition from Facial Features" part of the MIES - Autumn 2015 term project. 
We are using Active Shape Models and haarclassifiers for detecting the facial features.
Some attributes will be processed from these features, and after extraction, they will be trained to analyze the emotions. We are using the Jaffe database ( http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe_info.html ) for training the features. 
For the Active Shape Models, we are using the asmlib-opencv library ( https://github.com/cxcxcxcx/asmlib-opencv ).
